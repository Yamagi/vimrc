Overwiev                                   *vim-lsp-cquery-overview*

This plugin provides support for some cquery commands that are 
extensions to language server protocol and thus can not be 
implemented in vim-lsp directly. However this commands are usefull 
for c++ development and understanding existing c++ code bases. 
Currently, this commands include methods to request a list of all 
virtual functions that overload this function, all classes that 
inherit this class, all classes that are bases of this class and a 
list of all instances of a user defined class.

====================================================================
Usage                                         *vim-lsp-cquery-usage*

To use vim-lsp-cquery, first install vim-lsp plugin and all it's 
dependencies. Use your package manager of choise. For example,
with vim-plug add this lines to your vimrc:

    Plug 'prabirshrestha/async.vim'
    Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
    Plug 'pdavydov108/vim-lsp-cquery'

Install cquery language server and setup your project as described 
here: https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Getting-started
Usually, this boils down to installing cquery itself (they provide
binary releases), and getting compile_commands.json file from 
your build system of choise. In case of cmake, just add
-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=On to the command line. Also, if 
you have a separate directory where you build a project (like build 
dir), then compile_commands.json file will be generated there, so 
maybe it's a good idea to create a symbolic link to it from the root 
of your project, so that cquery can detect it.
Make vim-lsp plugin use cquery server, see here:
https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp/wiki/Servers-cquery
After this steps, vim-lsp-cquery server will be ready to roll. It 
will define a few additional commands, but no mappings, so please 
add them if you like.

====================================================================
Commands                                   *vim-lsp-cquery-commands*

Currently, there are three commands defined by this plugin. These 
are: LspCqueryDerived, LspCqueryBase, LspCqueryVars.
1. LspCqueryDerived - when used on a virtual function, will populate
quickfix window with the locations of virtual functions that 
override this one. When used on a class, will show a list of all 
classes that inherit this one.
2. LspCqueryBase - when used on a class, will return a list of all 
its parent classes.
3. LspCqueryVars - when used on a user defined class, will show a 
list of locations of all variables that are instances of this type.

====================================================================
Mappings                                   *vim-lsp-cquery-mappings*

This plugin does not define any mappings.  However, it is trivial 
to define your own. For example like so:

    autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp,cxx,h,hpp nnoremap <leader>fv :LspCqueryDerived<CR>
    autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp,cxx,h,hpp nnoremap <leader>fc :LspCqueryCallers<CR>
    autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp,cxx,h,hpp nnoremap <leader>fb :LspCqueryBase<CR>
    autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp,cxx,h,hpp nnoremap <leader>fi :LspCqueryVars<CR>

====================================================================
License                                     *vim-lsp-cquery-license*

vim-lsp-cquery uses a lot of code from vim-lsp, so it has the same
license as the original plugin.
