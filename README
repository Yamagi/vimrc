Welcome to my Vim configuration. This one of the more complex setups,
build around several plugins and a big bunch of customized options and
scripted functions. You may do with this files whatever you want, but
please note that they come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY! And the plugins, spell
checker files and colorschemes are covered by their specific licenses,
of course.

Caveats:
- Most comments are in german since I started in my native language
  years ago. And now I'm to lazy to translate everything.
- This configuration is build around my workflow. It may not suit
  yours. Especially if you're starting with Vim it's very highly
  recommended to start with an empty configuration!

Installation:
- Clone this repository into ~/.vim (Linux, OS X, Unix) or into
  ~/vimfiles (Windows).
- Symlink or copy the supplied vimrc-stub to ~/.vimrc (Linux, OS X,
  Unix) or ~/_vimrc (Windows).

If you want to use gvim you may need to touch an empty ~/.gvimrc. This
is because some systems install a global gvimrc which is executed when
no user supplied version is found.
